# Contribute to the project
There are six main ways to contribute to this project. The first one is test the
program and report the bugs founded. If you find any bug, please visit the
Testers section of this document to know how to report it to us.

The next way of collaboration with the project is to donate some money to help
in the mainteinance of the project. This money can be assigned to maintain the
project's servers (change hardware, renew the domain, ...) or to pay a developer
to work full time in the project. To know how to donate money to the project,
please visit the Donations section in this document.

If you prefer to translate either the program, the documentation or the web page
of the project in any of the languages needs, please visit the Translators
section of this document.

If you want to generate or modify the project's documentation, please visit the
Documenters section of this document.

If you want to contribute in the administration of the project's servers (where
we have the webpage, the git repository and all the resources of the project),
please visit the Administrators section of this document.

And, finally, if you want to help in the coding of the project, please visit the
Developers section of this document.

If you find another way to collaborate with the project, please contact with
palvarez@ritho.net exposing your idea.

## Testers
Tests, both manual and automatic ones, are a main part of the development process.
We have a set of tests that try to cover the majority of the project, but if you
want to help testing manually or writing new test suites it's always welcome.

To run manual tests you don't need to do anything but build the project and start
testing, and if you find any bug please report it to the github page
(https://github.com/radar-go/metrics/issues).

If you want to write new automatic test suites, please notify it to
palvarez@ritho.net or add a new task to github and assign it to yourself in order
to know who is working on which tests. Once you finish your test suite you can
make a pull request through github or you can send the patch to palvarez@ritho.net
in order to include it into the project.

## Donations
Right now we don't have any donations mechanism, but if you want to make a donation
(with money or hardware), please contact palvarez@ritho.net in order to check the
different alternatives to make the donation.

## Translators
The main language of this project is English, but translations are always
important, that's why we maintain an Spanish translation of the project. If you
want to collaborate with the translation of this project into Spanish or any
other language, please contact palvarez@ritho.net and we will discuss the role
you want to take in the project.

## Documenters
Documentation is one of the things that we usually miss in the free software
projects, specially good user documentation. For now the technical documentation
is based on godoc and comments, and we want to add more user and technical
documentation in the gitub wiki of the project, so if you are interested in
writing some documentation please write to palvarez@ritho.net to coordinate how
you want to help on the documentation part of the project.

## Administrators
For now we don't have almost anything to administrate in the project, just the
github project itself, but in the future, when the project grow, we want to have
some mail lists, a proper site, one or more servers to build and test the project
and a lot more of things, so if you are interested on take part of these or other
tools for the project, please contact palvarez@ritho.net and we will find the way
to do it.

## Developers
To help in the development part of the project you should start forking the
repository and play with the project itself. Once you're a little bit confortable
with it, you can chose to work on one of the issues on github, assigning it to
yourself, or in a new issue that you want to add to the code. If the new issue is
small enough, you don't need to do anything but code and do the PR when you're
finish, but with bigger issues it could be a better approach to create a new
issue in github and assign it to you, both to help us know that you're working
on it (and avoid other people to work on the same issue without coordinate wiht
you) and to check if the issue is aligned with the project goals.

There're two ways to be included in the organization, one is doing at least two
pull requests to the project (it's just a way of not including too much people
in the project that are not really active), and the other is talking with a
project admin letting him know what do you want to work on. If you stay a while
without participate in the project the admins can decide to get you out from
the organization, but you can return at any time you want.

Take in mind that participate in a free software project is not just about
coding, but we have to coordinate between ourselves in order to reach some common
goals and be open to a (respectful) criticism.
